# Objectives
Grouping related families of objects is very convenient when your object number is growing so much that creating a unique point to get them all seems the only way to gain the flexibility of runtime object creation.
* Provide a new layer of encapsulation for Factory methods that return a common interface for all factories.
* Group common factories into a _Super Factory_.
